# Converting TensorFlow Weight Files to TFLite Model

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for converting TensorFlow weight files to a TFLite model. The script is designed to be executed in a Colab environment.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have access to a GPU environment for efficient execution.
- Internet access is required for downloading dependencies.

## Installation and Setup

1. Download and install Miniconda:
   ```shell
   !wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
   !chmod +x Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
   !./Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local
   ```

2. Update Conda:
   ```shell
   !conda update conda
   ```

3. Create a Conda environment:
   ```shell
   !conda create -n myenv python=3.6
   ```

4. Activate the environment (Note: The following steps involving Conda environment activation are currently commented out in the script, so you might need to uncomment and run them as needed).

## TensorFlow and Pillow Installation

**Note**: This part of the script is currently commented out in the provided code but may be required based on your use case.

```shell
# Uncomment and run these commands if needed
# !pip install tensorflow==1.15
# !pip install Pillow
```

## Model Conversion

5. Convert the TensorFlow model to TFLite:
   - Run the script to load the TensorFlow model (`frozen_darknet_yolov3_model.pb`) and extract input and output node names.

   - Specify the input and output arrays in the TFLite Converter based on the extracted node names.

   - Apply optimizations to the TFLite model.

   - Generate the TFLite model and save it to `/content/model.tflite`.

   ```python
   # Run the script for model conversion
   # [Provide the code here or reference the script]
   ```

6. Calculate the size difference between the TensorFlow model and the TFLite model and print the results.

7. Rename the TFLite model file (currently commented out in the script).

## Inferencing with TFLite Model

8. Install Pillow (if not already installed) and run a Python script (`test_tflite.py`) for inferencing with the generated TFLite file.

   ```shell
   !pip install Pillow
   !python /test_tflite.py
   ```

## Additional Tools and Repositories

9. Install the "tool" package (no further details provided in the script).

10. Clone the repository for TensorRT inference and install the "onnx" package.

   ```shell
   !pip install onnx
   git clone https://github.com/linghu8812/tensorrt_inference.git
   ```

11. Export the TensorFlow model to ONNX format (`yolov3.onnx`) using the provided script.

    ```shell
    python3 export_onnx.py --cfg_file /content/gesture.cfg --weights_file /content/drive/MyDrive/yc_gesture_final.weights --output_file yolov3.onnx --strides 32 16 8 --neck FPN
    ```

12. Clone the YOLOv3-TensorRT repository for TensorRT integration.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/linghu8812/YOLOv3-TensorRT.git
    ```

13. Install "pycuda" and "nvidia-tensorrt" packages.

   ```shell
   !pip install pycuda
   !pip install nvidia-tensorrt==7.2.* --index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com
   ```

14. Convert the ONNX model to a TensorRT engine (`yolov3.trt`) using the provided script.

    ```shell
    python3 /content/YOLOv3-TensorRT/onnx_to_tensorrt.py --onnx_file /content/yolov3.onnx --engine_file yolov3.trt
    ```

That's it! You have successfully converted a TensorFlow weight file to a TFLite model and integrated it with TensorRT for efficient inference. Feel free to customize this guide and script as needed for your specific use case.
